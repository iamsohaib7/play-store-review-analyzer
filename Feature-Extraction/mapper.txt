text: very nice features and highly customizable! I've been testing a bunch of PDF readers tonight, planning to use it for book reading. I love the feature that locks the location of the screen even if you switch to the next page... it saves me from having to fiddle with each page. Apple Books should learn from Moon+ Reader's design :D

rating: 5

text: it's totally waste of time please nobody install this app because in the end of the settings they ask you for pay if you want to learn and it's minimum 7000 per week charges you so I advise you all please avoid anx don't install it

text: tthhdd wow that's awesome I'm glad to have this app in my TV!!
rating: 5

text: Unsatisfactory. The app is slow to load and doesn't open at the point where you finished studying. Nouns in the flash cards rarely have their article attached and the example/context sentences are not translated. Cancelling your subscription and deleting your account involves emailing 2 different addresses. A good idea very poorly executed.
rating: 2

text: this app is so buggy I don't even know where to begin to describe how awful it is.
rating: 1

text: I hardly know japanese, so I cannot say this for certain! This app heavily features AI images, and promotes AI within the premium plan (AI smart dictionary if i recall?) so I do not trust this app to give me proper translations. I already noticed a few errors within THE FIRST STORY!! This app has a promising premise. If only it were translated by actual humans.

text: As soon as I can I plan on paying yhe yearly fee. I came upon this app bc I was a little bored and liked the idea of practicing reading my Spanish. The first free read was wonderful.
rating: 5

text: to be honest I really liked this app I cant express how I liked this first it was step wise and drove me bored but eventually I couldn't believe what I got I can download any article what ever I wanted and I can download it it is incredible!
rating: 5

text: not native sound. only machine sound and translation, also some wrong translation in the stories. It was a wrong decision to buy this app it is bases on a good idea but execution is terrible I also reinstalled the software and learning language changed to Spanish flash card part is not useful and also buggy, sometimes if you click on memorized it gos to the first card and also it doesn't have the repetition and usefulness like Ankidroid and you need to copy new words to Ankidroid to learn them
rating: 1

text: great way to learn, great selection of bilingual texts in various languages,that is being constantly updated, it would be great to have some grammar as well. I am using premium version and it is totally worth it and not expensive at all!

I tried putting other meds, but it won't track them unless you set a daily reminder, and I just dont want a reminder for all of them. I would rather log some of them when I want to. I have the free version. it is possible the paid version allows for more wiggle room.

text: A very handy app for my adhd meds. What I would even love more would be them linked. Meaning that if I decide to take one chain later, the others would change with it. Like an interval for 3 hours. Instead of having to do it manually. Yes. What I mean is always a 3 hour interval (for example) so I don't mix up my time with my meds.

text: Needs to work on reminders. Reminds even in the middle of the night when the medicine is not to be taken. Needs to STOP reminders at some part of the day. It is 2.32 am IST now and it is reminding me of the meds to be taken in the morning at 8 am
