# Titlte: Enhancing App Features Through Real-Time User Reviews

## Description:
    The project aims to enhance app development by leveraging real-time user feedback from App Stores through advanced Natural Language Processing  
    (NLP) techniques. It automatically analyzes user reviews to identify common themes, issues, and feature requests, providing actionable insights  
    and recommendations for app improvements. Key features include an intuitive dashboard that visualizes user satisfaction levels, suggests new  
    features, and highlights necessary bug fixes. The system can also detect urgent issues, summarize reviews for easier understanding, and enable  
    developers to compare their app's performance with competitors. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback loop, allowing developers to contribute  
    insights that refine the system's recommendations over time. This comprehensive approach empowers developers to streamline the app improvement  
    process and gain a competitive edge by better understanding user needs.


### Project Roadmap

- [ ] Scrape any specific app details and it's all reviews and store them in any object storage
- [ ] Analyze the Structure of output and Create Database Schema
- [ ] Create Models for storing the App details and reviews in raw form
- [ ] Connect the Postgres SQL and store the app details
- [ ] Create the design for Front End website
- [ ] Create the Basic Structure for the website
- [ ] Start Creating Backend
- [ ] Identify Techniques to Transform the reviews into some useful information.
- [ ] Implement Data Collection (Scrapy, API Integration) for real-time review updates.
- [ ] Identify Techniques to scrape Competitors Information
- [ ] Develop NLP Preprocessing Pipeline:  
        * Tokenization and Text Cleaning  
        * Part-of-Speech Tagging  
        * Dependency Parsing  
        * Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- [ ] N-gram Extraction for common phrases and themes  
- [ ] Build Keyword Extraction & Topic Modeling (using TF-IDF, LDA).  
- [ ] Set up Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for feature prioritization (e.g., performance, usability).  
- [ ] Implement the Backend Logic for Real-Time Analysis of Reviews.  
- [ ] Integrate with Frontend to Display Dashboard Visualizations: 
        * Revency of reviews
        * Sentiment Graphs  
        * Feature Suggestions  
        * Competitor Comparison  
        * Urgent Issue Detection  
        * Summarized Insights  
- [ ] Add Customizable Filter Options (e.g., security, performance).  
- [ ] Set up Developer Feedback Loop for recommendation refinement.  
- [ ] Implement Testing and Debugging for each module.  
- [ ] Deploy Application (using Docker and AWS/GCP).
